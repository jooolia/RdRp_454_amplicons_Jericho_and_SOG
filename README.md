RdRp 454 amplicons Jericho and SOG
==================================

Repository to hold the code used to analyse the pyrosequencing data and to generate figures for the manuscript [High temporal and spatial diversity in marine RNA viruses implies that they have an important role in mortality and structuring plankton communities](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00703). 

Components:
scripts/ contains scripts needed for running all analyses. There are many software dependencies that are needed for running this analysis. They are noted in the scripts and in the manuscript. 
data/ contains data needed to perform analyses and generate figures. Original 454 data needed for the initial steps of the analysis can be found in [NCBI's BioProject PRJNA267690](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA267690).

Scripts labelled in the order that they should be used and can be run by runnning `bash  RdRp_454_amplicons_Jericho_and_SOG/scripts/RdRp_pipeline_runner.sh`.
